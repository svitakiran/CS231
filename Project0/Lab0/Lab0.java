 * This is a multi-line comment that begins with a forward slash and an asterisk and ends with an asterisk and a forward slash.
 * 
 * The content of this comment is equivalent to the Module Strings that you wrote in Python.
 * Every program you write should have a multiline comment at the top of the file. It should contain a description of the program, the author, and the date it was written.
 * 
 * 
 * Directions for Task 1 of Lab0: 
 * Below is a template for the first lab portion of the course. It contains a series of tasks to be completed by the student.
 * The tasks cover topics found in the first section (mostly) of the W3Schools tutorial (https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp) 
 * This lab focuses on Java syntax and basic programming concepts.
 * 
 * Your job is to complete all the tasks in each topic area by providing the missing code.
 * Once you have finished the tasks related to a topic area, run the program to see if your output matches the expected output.
 * If it does, then move on to the next topic. If it does not, then review your code to find and fix the error(s).
 * If you are unable to find the error, then ask for help from the instructor or a TA.   
 * 
 * Note: Be sure not to modify any of the program's existing code.
